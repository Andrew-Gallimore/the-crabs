# ğŸ¦€ Crabs
A simple video game built in Octave

## About

I am creating this game as part of my STEM Professionals class in college. The game is simple in nature, being only a captain that moved around the screen to attack a crab, but it has taken alot of work to get it working. Specifically, I...
- Created many files for different functions for the game
- Learned to import images into the game/window
- Learned how to construct dynamic character points & lines
- Learned to do matrix multiplation to translate & rotate the captain

## Functions used

| Name       | Description | Calls | Arguements | Returns
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
